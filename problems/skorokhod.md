title: Homework problem - the Skorokhod embedding
description: Skorokhod embedding
---

Consider Durrett's proof of the Skorokhod embedding (theorem 8.1.1 in the fifth edition).


1. Show by example that the stopping time $T_{U,V}$ constructed in this proof is *not*
    in general the same as the one we constructed in class to prove the same theorem,
    even though $B_T \stackrel{d}{=} X$ in both cases.

2. Rewrite Durrett's proof in your own words, by doing something like the following:
    (a) understand the proof and write down notes of how it works,
    and then (b) looking at your notes but *not* the book, write out the proof,
    making sure to explain the various steps with complete sentences.
