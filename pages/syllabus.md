## Description of the course

This is the final quarter of our graduate course on probability theory,
following 671 (Measure Theory) and 672 (Theory of Probability, part I).
We are following Durrett, *Probability: theory and examples* fairly closely,
and are continuing in this quarter to cover the latter half of the book,
which focuses more on particularly important sub-topics in probability theory
(e.g., Markov chains, Brownian motion).
The goals are to use theory developed so far,
learn new techniques and concepts,
and to become more familiar with working with probability
(particularly stochastic processes).
